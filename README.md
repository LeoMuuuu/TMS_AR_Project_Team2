# TMS_AR_Project_Team2

This document describes an augmented reality (AR) application developed in Unity for the Android platform. 

The application relies on Vuforia for AR functionality and establishes a TCP connection between a PC and an Android phone. The Python scripts included in the project are primarily used for registration purposes and for managing NDI transformations. The C# script in the unity package will receive the pose from the Python side on PC, and set the position of the blue marker in the Android app.
